Many people have contributed to the creation of this thesis. I would first like
to thank my advisor, Darryn Waugh, for his patience, guidance, and thoughtful
support. I am also deeply indebted to Anand Gnanadesikan, my secondary advisor,
for sharing his knowledge with me throughout this 5 year process. This work would
not be possible without the generous funding from the National Science Foundation
under Grant FESD-1338814. \\

Completing a thesis is a daunting task - one that was made less so with the
support of my husband, Andrew, along with all my closest friends and family.\\

My time in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department has been incredibly enjoyable.
Many thanks to everyone who was a part of it.
