\chapter{Relationship between age and oxygen}
\label{cha:oxygen}

\section{Abstract}
The relationship between age and oxygen is one that is often assumed in oceanography to be relatively simple. Because oxygen utilization rates are difficult to directly measure in the ocean, it is commonly assumed that the apparent oxygen utilization divided by the water age is a good representation of respiration. Likewise, because of limited transient tracer observations and difficulties constraining water age, it has been suggested that oxygen could be a useful proxy for age. In this paper, we explore the relationship between age and oxygen along observational Line W, a repeat hydrography cruise track which transects the Gulf Stream, extending from Cape Cod to Bermuda and in an Earth System Model simulation to determine if these assumptions can safely be made. We find that in both the observations and model, the assumed negative linear relationship between age and oxygen is not found both within and directly below the ventilated thermocline at the end of Line W. This result is consistent with our model simulation, which also shows that the relationship between age and oxygen is more complicated than often assumed. While observations along Line W shows a decoupling of the biologically-driven age-oxygen relationship, our model analysis indicates that this phenomenon is relatively localized to Line W due to the combination of relatively weak horizontal gradients in age and oxygen resulting reduced along-isopycnal variability and vertical heave acting on a depth offset between age and oxygen extrema.

\section{Introduction}
When examining the relationship between age and oxygen it is generally assumed that the two follow a negative relationship. Oxygen concentration is set at the surface and generally decreases in the ocean interior due to biological consumption. Age on the other hand, is set to zero at the surface and increases in the ocean interior, characterizing the time spent since last in contact with the surface. This relationship between age and oxygen is exploited in the oceanography in two ways. The first is that allows for the indirect measurement of the oxygen utilization rate to diagnose changes in ocean productivity, and the second is that it allows for the possibility to use oxygen as a proxy for age when examining changes in ocean circulation.
The primary sink of oxygen is the utilization by biology. For this reason, the oxygen utilization rate (OUR) is a powerful tool for understanding ocean biology and biogeochemistry. In the ocean interior, the OUR is generally very small and therefore very difficult to directly measure. A commonly used solution to this is to estimate the OUR as the derivative of the change in AOU over the change in age:

\begin{equation}
  OUR = \frac{dAOU}{d\Gamma} = \frac{d([O_{2 sat}] - [O_2])}{d\Gamma}
\end{equation}

This definition of OUR is fairly ubiquitous in the ocean biogeochemistry community. It is referenced in multiple textbooks (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2006; Emerson and Hedges, 2008), and has been used extensively in the literature to draw conclusions on organic matter transport from the surface ocean to the deep (Jenkins, 1982), and quantify biological productivity in the ocean (Burd et al, 2010). However, as discussed in Koeve et al.(2016), this method for determining OUR assumes that the advective and diffusive transports impact the age and oxygen in the same way. This will only be strictly true if the two tracer fields have the same distribution of internal sinks, something which is general is not the case. The authors found that when averaged over three coupled physical and biogeochemical ocean models, the OUR determined by this method underestimated the actual modeled OUR by a factor of 3. This result suggests that the relationship between age and oxygen is not as straightforward as often assumed.

Another way that oxygen and age have been combined in the field is through the suggestion that oxygen could be used as a proxy for age for quantifying changes in ocean circulation. While transient tracers are a useful tool for understanding ocean circulation, there are some well-documented complications in estimating age from such tracers (REF: Haine and Hall?). Additionally, transient tracer measurements are made much less frequently than oxygen measurements, making it impossible to directly estimate ocean age from the historical record. To resolve these problems, the possibility of exploiting the age-oxygen relationship and using oxygen as a proxy for age has been suggested in the physical oceanography community. Changes in oxygen concentration could be used to diagnose changes in ocean circulation when age measurements are unavailable (example: Deutsch, Emerson and Thompson, GRL, 2005; Kwon, Deutsch et al., J. Climate, 2016). However, in order for this methodology to be successful, the negative correlation relationship between age and oxygen would need to be robust over time and space.
Because age and oxygen concentration are subject to diffusive mixing and advective transport processes, the both of these hypothesized relationships only hold when advection is the dominant process, or when remineralization rates are spatially and temporally uniform. In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between age and oxygen to shed light on where it may be valid to use oxygen as a proxy for age and to consider the use of defining OUR as AOU divided by mean age. Because it crosses the western boundary current in the North Atlantic Ocean, and has measured both transient tracer and oxygen concentrations, Line W provides a unique opportunity to investigate the assumed negative relationship between age and oxygen and examine the robustness of the two mentioned applications of this age-oxygen relationship. Because of the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the Line W observational data, we supplement the observational data analysis with analysis of an earth system model, GFDL ESM2Mc.

In the next section we introduce the Line W observational data set, describe how transient tracer ages were derived, and discuss the earth system model specifications. In Section 3 we explore the age-oxygen relationship in the observations and model, and discuss mechanisms driving the resulting relationship. Finally, in Section 4 we share our conclusions.

\section{Methods}
\label{section:methods}

\subsection{Line W Observational Data}
\subsubsection{Data Collection}
The observational data set used in this analysis comes is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's (WHOI) Line W ship-based repeat hydrography study. Observations include full-depth temperature and salinity profiles, horizontal velocity profiles from lowered ADCPs (LADCPs), and bottle-sampled transient tracer and oxygen concentrations.  Data was collected once or twice-per-year (one cruise in the spring and one in the fall) over the 2003-2012 period. The Line W cruise line extends from just south of the coast of Cape Cod (40.29 N, 70.21 W) and extends to Bermuda (32.16 N, 65.23 W - Figure 1 (a)). The water property and velocity measurements were taken at 26 fixed sites along Line W. The stations are more densely situated across the continental shelf to resolve the Deep Western Boundary Current. The station spacing becomes greater and temporal sampling frequency is lower along the end of the Line W tract, near Bermuda.
	Temperature and salinity data was collected using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument mounted on a rosette frame. Salinity (i.e. conductivity) measurements were then validated with bottle measurements of salinity (Millard and Yang, 1993). Bottle measurements were sampled using 10-L Nisken bottles mounted on a rosette. Generally, 23 bottle samples at various depths were taken at each location along the cruise line. Water samples were analyzed on board for salts, dissolved oxygen, and transient tracer concentrations. The transient tracers sampled include multiple chlorofluorocarbon compounds: CCl3F (CFC-11), CCl2F2 (CFC-12), and CCl2FCClF2 (CFC-13).
For a full description of the Line W data set please reference Andres et al, 2017. The data is available on the WHOI Line W website (http://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/linew).

\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Data Processing}
For purposes of visualization and comparison with the Earth System Model, the data has been interpolated to a grid with a vertical resolution of 100 dbars and horizontal resolution of 10 km. Cross-sections of oxygen concentration and mean age (described below) for two years are shown in Figure 2. Oxygen is generally high at the surface and decreases with depth, reaching a minimum between depths 250 dbars and 750 dbars. Age on the other hand is at a minimum at the surface and increases with depth. (NOTE SMALLER-SCALE FEATURES SEEN IN BOTH PLOTS). Figure 2 additionally shows the time-series of two locations along Line W (as indicated by the black boxes). The first time-series (Figure 2 (e)) suggests that there is a positive correlation between age and oxygen. The second time-series (Figure 2 (f)) on the other-hand shows the anticipated negative relationship between age and oxygen.
Because temperature and salinity impact oxygen saturation, we additionally compute the Apparent Oxygen Utilization for the observational data:

\begin{equation}
AOU = O_{2 sat} - O_2
\end{equation}

where $O_{2 sat}$ is the equilibrium saturation concentration of oxygen, calculated as a function of temperature and salinity, and $O_2$ is the observed oxygen concentration. The AOU is a measure of how under-saturated the oxygen sample is. Using the AOU instead of oxygen concentration allows us to ignore the impacts of temperature on the oxygen measurement.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mean Age Calculation}
A critical component to understanding ocean circulation and quantifying biological respiration is estimating the age of the water - or how long since the water was last in contact with the surface. Doing this with observations is not easy, but transient tracers make it possible. Because of the atmospheric time history of Chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), and the fact that CFCs have no sources and sinks in the ocean, CFCs are often used to quantify the age of ocean water. The simplest way of doing this is to assume that CFCs are in equilibrium with the atmosphere when they leave the ocean surface and are then transported advectively to the observation site. One can then deduce the date at which the water was subducted by matching the partial pressure of CFCs in the water to the date at which they had that concentration in the atmosphere.  This assumes that the transport to a given point can be characterized by a single timescale- the advective time.
In reality, estimating the age is complicated by mixing in the ocean. Because all flow is a combination of advective and diffusive flow, there is no one timescale that characterizes the time that a parcel of water has taken to reach an interior location from the surface. Because of this advective and diffusive flow, we characterize the timescales of a given point in the ocean interior with a distribution if transit times (or transit time distribution).
	The basis for this transit time distribution (TTD) approach for estimating ocean age is that for steady transport, the interior concentration of a transient tracer, $c(r,t)$, is given by (Haine and Hall, 2002):

\begin{equation}
	c(r,t) = \int_{0}^{\infty}c(t-t')G(r,t')dt'
\end{equation}

where $G(r,t)$ is a function describing the TTD at location r and time t. Measurements of CFC-12 were used to estimate the TTD assuming that (1) the TTD follows an Inverse Gaussian distribution and (2) the ratio of the mean width to mean age ($\Delta⁄\Gamma$) of the Inverse Gaussian is approximately equal to 1 (Waugh et al, 2003; Waugh et al, 2004; Waugh et al, 2006). Making the assumptions in order to estimate $G(r,t)$ using the Line W CFC-12 data and using the atmospheric history of CFC-12 allows us to estimate the mean age of the water sample.

\subsection{Model Data}
In addition to the observational data, we use an Earth system model (GFDL ESM2Mc) to quantify the relationship between oxygen and age. GFDL ESM2Mc (Galbraith et al, 2011) is a coarse resolution configuration of the GFDL ESM2M (Dunne et al., 2012). The model has an atmospheric resolution of 3.875  x 3  with 24 vertical levels. The ocean model is non-Boussinesq, using pressure as the vertical coordinate, and has a resolution of 3  x 1.5  and 28 vertical levels. The oceanic model also has a coupled biogeochemical module referred to as the Biogeochemistry with Light Iron Nutrients and Gases (BLING) model (Galbraith et al., 2010). Although this module uses a highly parameterized biological cycle, it predicts patterns of carbon and oxygen change in response to global warming that are very similar to a more complex biogeochemistry simulation in ESM2M (Galbraith et al., 2015). The model also computes an ideal age (Thiele and Sarmiento, 1990), setting this tracer to zero in the surface box and allowing it to increase at 1 yr/yr in the ocean interior. For a full description of the model simulation, please reference Section XX (from chapter 3).

The model is interpolated to 1$\times$1  grid in the North Atlantic and then interpolated to a line extending from position (40 N, 69 W) to (22 N, 60 W) to match observational Line W (Figure 1 (a)). The model shows a similar temperature and salinity profile on Line W compared with the observations (Figure 1 (b) - (e)). The model simulation is used as a supplement to the observational data analysis and to investigate potential mechanisms affecting the age-oxygen relationship.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Age and Oxygen Relationship}

The climatologies of the calculated mean tracer age and oxygen concentration from the Line W observations are shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b). Observing the two plots, in general there appears to be a negative relationship between the age and oxygen. There is relatively high oxygen concentration and zero age at the surface, consistent with the surface waters being in contact with the atmosphere, resulting in near-equilibrium in oxygen and CFC concentrations. Age then generally increases with depth, reaching a local maximum at just below the average depth of the 27.5 neutral density surface. Oxygen on the other hand generally decreases with depth, reaching a local-minimum along the average depth of the 27.5 neutral density surface. The spatial patterns of age and oxygen generally point towards a negative relationship between the two qualities, particularly at intermediate depths. Oxygen shows a core of minimum values with two intense patches, where the concentrations drop below 160  M, on either side of the Gulf Stream more or less aligned with the 27.5 neutral density surface. Age also shows two such patches of high values on either side of the Gulf Stream at similar depths. However, there are interesting differences in the detailed structure. First, the age maximum found just below the ventilated thermocline at distances 300-500 km occurs at a depth of 1000 dbars. This is lower in the water column than the oxygen minimum, which occurs at an approximate depth of 800 dbars. Additionally, there is significantly more spatial variability in the age in the deeper regions across all distances than is seen in the oxygen climatology. These differences between the spatial patterns suggest the relationship between age and oxygen is likely more complicated than has been suggested in previous work.
As discussed in the introduction, because of the limited temporal and spatial resolution of the observational data, we also examine the age-oxygen relationship in an Earth System Model. The vertical structure of the modeled oxygen and age climatologies (Figure 3 (c) and (d)) are similar to the observed climatologies, though somewhat offset in density space. The modeled oxygen concentration exhibits a local minimum close to the 27.0 average neutral density surfaces, while the age reaches a local maximum on the 27.5 average neutral density surface. While the vertical structure of age and oxygen in the model are similar to the observations, there is a more obvious offset between the depths of the local oxygen minimum and local age maximum in the model. As with the observational data, this suggests a possible breakdown of the suggested negative relationship between age and oxygen in this region. Note also that our relatively coarse model does not allow for separation of two cores of low oxygen water by the Gulf Stream, arguably, only the offshore core seen in the observations is simulated with some measure of fidelity.

To better quantify the temporal relationship between mean age and oxygen, the Pearson correlation coefficient between age and oxygen is calculated along Line W (Figure 4 (a)).  Although this figure shows the anticipated negative correlation between age and oxygen, in much of the plot the correlations are relatively low.  Moreover, two regions of positive correlation are apparent between 200 and 400 km offshore. One positive correlation region is at approximate depths 500-750 dbars (between neutral density surfaces 27.0 and 27.5), and the second is slightly deeper at depths 1250 - 2000 dbars. Given the anticipated anti-correlation between age and oxygen, especially in the ventilated thermocline, both the low correlations through much of the sections and the regions of positive correlation are surprising.

One possible reason for the lack of a tight relationship between oxygen and age is that oxygen concentration depends on solubility and thus on temperature and salinity. In order to correct for this effect, we also examine the relationship between the age and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). The AOU is a measure of how under-saturated the oxygen concentration is. This under-saturation is usually due to the biological consumption of oxygen but may also see an effect from incomplete equilibration of sinking source waters, particularly in convective regions. Analyzing the relationship between AOU and age gives us similar information to the age-oxygen relationship, however, because we are subtracting the oxygen concentration from the oxygen saturation, the AOU-age relationship will be the opposite sign (mainly positive) and the AOU-age relationship removes the impacts of temperature (and salinity) on oxygen saturation.

The Pearson correlation coefficient between age and AOU (Figure 4 (b)) shows a positive relationship between the two quantities.  Similar to the pattern seen in the age-oxygen correlation coefficients (Figure 4 (a)), there are two regions with anomalous correlation. One upper region of near-zero correlation, corresponds with the upper region of positive correlation seen in Figure 4 (a). This suggests that this positive correlation between age and oxygen in this region largely results from temperature effects. Younger waters in this region are colder and thus hold more oxygen-countering any impacts from less remineralization. Note however, that even with temperature effects removed the AOU-age correlation remains low. Moreover, the region with anomalous O2-age correlation in the deeper waters also shows an anomalous AOU-age correlation (negative).  The fact that these patterns exist in the age-AOU correlation pattern in addition to the age-O2 correlation pattern suggest that we need to find a mechanism other than solubility changes for explaining such variability.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{correlation.png}
\caption{Pearson correlation coefficients for age versus (left) oxygen and (right) AOU for Line W observations. Contour lines indicate average neutral density climatology.}
\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

We also show the Pearson correlation coefficient for the model simulation (Figure 4 (c) and (d)). Although the model also shows the expected negative correlation between age and oxygen over much of the domain, the correlation if far from uniform with one core of strong positive correlation in denser waters around 1000 dbars and a second layer of negative correlation at around 300 dbars.  As in the observations, there is a region of positive correlation (with correlation coefficient of approximately 0.4) between the negative correlation layers, starting at distance 400 km and extending to the end of Line W. This region of positive correlation is similar to the upper region of positive correlation seen in the observational record. Interestingly, in the model simulation, there is no deeper region of positive correlation as seen in the observational correlation, although there is a decline in the correlations as one approaches the coast below 1500 dbars.

The modeled age-AOU temporal correlation shows a very consistent pattern with the modeled age-oxygen correlation. The area of anomalous correlation (now negative) around depth 500 dbars is greatly reduced in Figure 4 (d), suggesting that a fraction of the positive correlation seen in the age-oxygen correlation is due to solubility- a signal similar to that seen in the observations. However, as in the observations this region still has a reduced positive correlation, suggesting some additional mechanism is impacting the age-AOU relationship.

\subsection{Age and Oxygen/AOU Scatterplots}

To better visualize and analyze the relationship between the mean age and oxygen along observational Line W, we show the scatter plot of age versus oxygen in Figure 5 (a). The scatter points are colored with each location's temporal correlation coefficient (same as in Figure 4 (a)). The 'S-shape' of the age-oxygen scatterplot relationship roughly follows the depth of the water column, with the surface waters at the left end of the 'S-shape' and the deep waters at the right end. The positive correlation regions indicated from Figure 4 (a) also appear in this relationship.

The scatter plot relationship between age and AOU is also shown (Figure 5 (b)).  Similar to the age-oxygen scatter plot, the age-AOU scatter plot also roughly follows depth, with the surface waters at the left-hand side of the scatter plot, transitioning to the deeper waters at the right hand-side. The upper region of reduced/zero correlation discussed with Figure 4 (b) is seen on this diagram at an age of 50 years, just before the maximum in AOU. Additionally, the deeper region of negative correlation discussed in Figure 4 (b) is seen on this diagram on the almost-flat tail end of the scatterplot. Visualizing the age-AOU relationship in this way is a powerful tool because it allows us to gain initial insight to the mechanisms governing the AOU variability. The dashed lines represent expected linear relationships between age and AOU with the slope of the linear relationship being directly proportional to the rate of remineralization. At the surface, where sinking particulate matter has higher concentrations and is more easily decomposed, we have increased rates of remineralization, and therefore we would expect the age-AOU relationship to follow one of the linear relationships with a higher slope. As we move deeper in the water column, the slopes should decrease to reflect the slower rates of remineralization in the deep ocean.

If the variability in AOU were driven exclusively by changes in the rate of ventilation (but not the pathways of ventilation or the rate of remineralization), we would expect the age-AOU relationship to fall along one of the dashed lines.  The upper region does follow this linear relationship (with a slope of 1.7  M/yr). When the age-AOU relationship does not follow these linear lines however, it indicates that other processes are influencing the spatial (and thus potentially the temporal) variability in AOU. The right-hand tail of this relationship, where the correlation is negative, does not follow the anticipated linear relationship, and therefore we can infer that some additional process is influencing the AOU-age relationship. This region is also one where the correlation between AOU and age is (unexpectedly) negative.

The shape of the modeled relationship between age and oxygen is similar to the shape of the observed age-oxygen relationship (Figure 5 (a)), suggesting that the model captures the mean relationships to a surprising extent (given the coarseness of its resolution and the simplicity of its biological model). However, there are clear differences between the modelled and observed variability.  In the model, the area of positive correlation between the age and oxygen occurs in the region of the oxygen minimum, which is a region where the age is still increasing with depth. Since the shape of the relationship roughly follows depth, movement along this curve would correspond to vertical movement in the water column. In this region, if we move lower in the water column, age increases and oxygen also increases, therefore resulting in a positive correlation. This suggests that vertical movement in the water column could be causing the positive correlation. In the observations, however, the upper region of positive correlation is found above the oxygen minimum and the lower region is found around a weak age minimum. The corresponding point on the modelled age-oxygen plot shows some near-zero correlations, but no positive values.

The modeled age-AOU scatter plot (Figure 5 (d)) has similarities to the observed age-AOU relationship (Figure  (b)), but has a much more pronounced mid-depth age minimum. As in Figure 5 (b), the dashed grey lines represent the linear relationship between the age and AOU. In the upper region of the domain, the age and AOU follow this linear relationship quite closely (with a slope of 1.7  M/yr -similar to the observations). Slightly deeper in the water column, the age and AOU also closely follow a linear line, with a slightly smaller slope (slope of 0.8). In the deeper waters however, the age-AOU relationships break away from the linear model, suggesting additional processes impacting the AOU variability.

Some part of the mean relationship is driven by the well-known decrease in the remineralization of organic material with depth (see for example Armstrong et al., Deep Sea Res., 2002) as unprotected organic materials are preferentially consumed near the surface. This would move points between a steeply-sloped linear relationship near the surface to lying along a line with a flatter slope at depth. An additional factor is that the pathways of ventilation change with depth, with waters near the deep age minima more affected by the southward flow of North Atlantic Deep Water. These different factors have the potential to affect the variability as well. In particular, changing pathways of ventilation would be expected to change the mix of water masses seen at a given point. Assuming the water masses involved in this mixing are reflected in the AOU-age structure, such changes might be expected to produce relationships parallel to the age-AOU curve- which in many locations would imply anti-correlation (where the mean curve slopes down to the right) or near-zero correlation (where the mean curve is oriented either horizontally or vertically). We note that when the age-AOU curve lies along one of these dashed lines, it is impossible to distinguish changes in ventilation rate from changes in water mass type without bringing in more information.
The region of reduced positive correlation seen in the depth profile of the age-AOU Pearson correlation coefficient (Figure 4 (d)) is seen in the age-AOU scatterplot (Figure 4(d)) at the apex of the scatter plot, where the AOU goes from increasing with age to decreasing with age. This region occurs between the two regions of strong linear relationship between age and AOU as discussed above. This result suggests that it is a change in the fraction of water associated with two water masses that is contributing to the reduced positive correlation in age versus AOU (or positive in the age-oxygen correlation).

This analysis provides some initial insight to why the age-oxygen relationship displays an area of positive correlation. The age-AOU scatter plot suggests that mixing between water masses may be contributing to the anomalous correlation in the age-oxygen and age-AOU relationships. In the next section, we will investigate the mechanisms driving the modeled variability in age and oxygen further, examining whether the results can be simply explained in terms of vertical excursions of density, or whether more subtle changes in circulation are involved.


\subsection{Mechanisms Driving Age and Oxygen Variability}
In this section, we will use the model simulation to assess the spatial extent of the anomalous correlation outside of Line W and diagnose the most likely mechanisms responsible for the break-down in the anticipated age-AOU relationship.

\subsubsection{Horizontal Extent of Anomalous Correlation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{age_aou_corr_iso_sfc.pdf}
\caption{Correlation between age and AOU on various isopycnal surfaces. Left column indicate correlation calculated on average depth of the isopycnal surface, and therefore including contributions from isopycnal heave. Right column shows correlation calculated on the isopycnal surface and does not include contributions from heave.}
\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

To determine the horizontal extent of the anomalous correlation between age and AOU, we show the age-AOU temporal correlation from the model on various neutral density surfaces over the entire North Atlantic basin (see left-hand side of Figure 6). These correlations show that the temporal relationship between age and AOU is largely positive throughout the entire domain with Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding XXX  in most of the basin. There is a region at the end of Line W where the age-AOU correlation is reduced. This is most prominently seen on the lower neutral density surfaces (Figures 6 (e) and (g))).
The subplots on the right-hand side show the correlation on each designated density surface ignoring the impacts of vertical heave in the isopycnals, while the subplots on the left side do include vertical isopycnal heave as described by the following equations:

\begin{equation}
	r_{\mathrm{with \; heave}} = \mathrm{corr}(\Gamma, O_2)|_{\gamma_n = 27.0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	r_{\mathrm{without \; heave}} = \mathrm{corr}(\Gamma|_{\gamma_n = 27.0}, O_2|_{\gamma_n = 27.0})
\end{equation}

In both equations (2) and (3) above, $\gamma_n$  designates the depth of a neutral density surface and the overbar designates the time average. It is important to distinguish between these two methods of neutral density interpolation because the `with heave' method includes the impact of vertical motion and allows us to determine the extent that vertical motion impacts the correlation. The positive correlation appears to be more significantly reduced on the neutral density surfaces including vertical heave (left-hand side subplots). These results suggest that the mechanism decoupling age and AOU is spatially limited to the region at the end of Line W and includes some component of vertical mixing.


\subsubsection{Line W versus Line 40N}
In order to diagnose what is causing this reduction in the negative age-oxygen correlation and positive age-AOU correlation, we examine a region of the North Atlantic where this breakdown of the age-AOU relationship does not occur and compare it with Line W. We refer to this region as Line 40N, a hypothetical transect that extends from Cape Cod eastward along latitude line 40 N. This hypothetical transect follows along a region of the North Atlantic basin where the age-oxygen correlation is strongly negative (not shown) and the age-AOU correlation is strongly positive for all neutral density surfaces (Figure 6). Comparing Line 40N and Line W allows us to evaluate the differences between the two and understand why Line W achieves these zero correlations in the age-AOU relationship.
One possible reason Line 40N maintains a strong positive correlation is due to strong horizontal (primarily along-isopycnal) variability relative to Line W. In order to diagnose the relative contributions of this along-isopycnal variability and the isopycnal heave variability, we break the time rate of change of age and AOU as follows:

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{spice_figure.pdf}
\caption{Climatologies of (a) age and (b) AOU interpolated on neutral density surface 27.0.

Bottom plots are calculated as the standard deviation of the first term on right-hand side of equation (4).}
\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\Gamma}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_z = \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\Gamma}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{\gamma_n=27.0} + \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{\gamma_n=27.0} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Gamma}{\mathrm{d}z}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}AOU}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_z = \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}AOU}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{\gamma_n=27.0} + \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{\gamma_n=27.0} \frac{\mathrm{d}AOU}{\mathrm{d}z}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{age_aou_corr_linew_line40N.png}
\caption{Age-AOU correlation and vertical profiles for (top) Line W and (bottom) Line 40N.}
\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

where the first term on the right-hand side refers to the age tendency on the neutral density surface and the second term on the right-hand refers to the contribution of vertical heave to the age variability. The climatologies of age and oxygen on the n=27.0 surface along with the standard deviation of the age and oxygen tendencies along this surface are shown in Figure 7. The end of Line W, where the age-oxygen relationship becomes positive, lies in a region where there is reduced horizontal gradient in age and oxygen. This is significantly different to Line 40N, which lies in a region where the horizontal gradients in age and oxygen (primarily in the meridional direction) are particularly strong. This results in significantly more along-isopycnal variability along Line 40N than Line W, as shown in figure 7 (c) and (d). Because of the reduced along-isopycnal variability on Line W, the vertical heave component (second term on right hand side of equations 4 and 5) may be important in setting up the reduced positive correlation between age and AOU.

To investigate the vertical heave contribution to the age-AOU correlation, we show the correlation between age and AOU for Line W and Line 40N in Figure 8. As previously discussed, Line W has an anomalous region of zero correlation. Line 40N on the other hand has a strong positive correlation between age and AOU in the upper 1500 dbars of the cross section. Figure 8 also compares the vertical profiles of age and AOU along both lines. There is a visible offset between the depths of the age and AOU maximum (as indicated by the stars) with the age maximum occurring lower in the water column (XXX depth) than the AOU maximum (XXX depth). Between the age and AOU maximums, age increases with depth and AOU decreases with depth. It is between these depths that the reduced positive correlation occurs between age and AOU (as indicated by grey shading in Figure 8). We propose that the reduced correlation occurs because of vertical motion acting on this particular vertical gradient in age and AOU. When comparing the vertical profiles on Line W with Line 40N, we see that there is no offset between the age and AOU maximums on Line 40N. We also examined the magnitude of the vertical motion of the isopycnal surfaces (not shown) and found no significant difference between Line W and Line 40N. While both transects have similar levels vertical motion, the presence of a depth offset between the age and AOU maximum in addition to decreased along-isopycnal variability result in Line W having a reduced correlation between age and AOU.


Line W is unusual because the along-isopycnal (horizontal) gradients are small so that variations in mixing or along-isopcynal velocity will have relatively small impacts. This allows the vertical isopycnals heave to dominate the local variability in age and oxygen. Between depths 500 dbars - 750 dbars, this vertical heave acts on an offset in the depths of the age maximum and oxygen minimum, resulting in the observed positive correlation. In other regions of the basin (Line 40N), the horizontal mixing is large enough to dominate the local variability. Even though the same vertical heave and age maximum and oxygen minimum depth offset is seen in this region, the large magnitude of horizontal mixing maintains the expected age-oxygen relationship.

\section{Conclusions}
Our analysis of the Line W observations of age and oxygen show that there is a much more complicated relationship between the two quantities than one would naively expect. The commonly held expectation of a negative relationship between age and oxygen breaks down along observational Line W due to two regions of positive correlation. One region of positive correlation is seen within the ventilated thermocline and the other is lower in the water column. The same upper region of positive correlation is seen in an Earth System Model (GFDL ESM2Mc) representation of Line W. We additionally remove the impacts of temperature on oxygen saturation, by looking at the age correlation with AOU. The age-AOU correlation also shows anomalous (zero to negative) correlation in the observational data set and model simulation.

Because of the limited temporal and spatial resolution of the observational data, we use the GFDL ESM2Mc to investigate the potential mechanisms causing the anomalous correlation between and oxygen/AOU. We show that the region of anomalous correlation is limited to a region at the end of Line W, and to a few isopycnal surfaces (surfaces 27.0-27.5). The end of Line W lies in a unique region in the North Atlantic basin where the horizontal gradients in age and oxygen are relatively weak and thus the along-isopycnal variability is very small. Additionally, at the bottom of the ventilated thermocline, there is a depth offset between the age maximum and oxygen minimum resulting in a range of depths where the vertical gradient in age and oxygen are the same sign. Any vertical motion within this region, coupled with the limited horizontal variability, would cause a positive correlation between the age and oxygen.

The end of Line W is unique because it lies in the approximate center of the North Atlantic gyre circulation (Figure 10). Because the horizontal circulation in the middle of the gyre is very small, there is little horizontal gradients in ocean tracers. In such regions, the balance between vertical heaving of isopycnals (which acts to decouple age-oxygen) and horizontal mixing (which mostly strengthens age-oxygen relationship) determines whether or not the expected age-oxygen relationship holds. Because of this delicate balance, one needs to consider the local dynamics before assuming that oxygen and age follow a strong negative relationship.
